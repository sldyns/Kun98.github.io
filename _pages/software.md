## Bioinformatics Software Packages

### [SpaHDmap](https://github.com/sldyns/SpaHDmap)

SpaHDmap is based on a multi-modal neural network that takes advantage of the high-dimensionality of transcriptomics data and the high-definition of image data to achieve interpretable high-definition dimension reduction.

**Key Features:**

* Interpretable high-resolution dimension reduction
* Integration of multiple spatial transcriptomics data

### [scINSIGHT](https://github.com/sldyns/scINSIGHT)
scINSIGHT uses a novel matrix factorization model to jointly analyze multiple single-cell gene expression samples from biologically heterogeneous sources, such as different disease phases, treatment groups, or developmental stages.

**Key Features:**
* Integration of multiple datasets with batch effect correction
* Detection of condition-specific gene expression patterns
* Automated parameter selection

### [scAce](https://github.com/sldyns/scAce) 
scAce is an adaptive embedding and clustering method for scRNA-seq data. It consists of three major steps: a pre-training step based on a variational autoencoder, a cluster initialization step to obtain initial cluster labels, and an adaptive cluster merging step to iteratively update cluster labels and cell embeddings.

**Key Features:**

* Adaptive embedding and clustering
* Scalable for large scale scRNA-seq data

### [scBiG](https://github.com/sldyns/scBiG)
scBig is a novel computational framework for learning low-dimensional embeddings of scRNA-seq data, which uses a graph autoencoder to extract high-order representations of cells and genes from the cell-gene bipartite graph.

**Key Features:**

* Gene-cell relationship modeling
* Preserves biological structure
